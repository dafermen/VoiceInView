# Phase 0 implementation report
Status: foundation implemented; acceptance validation PENDING.
## Implemented / files
Native SwiftUI app entry and accessible/scrollable home screen; iOS 26.0 Xcode app target; shared scheme; XCTest UI smoke target; .gitignore; README; CHANGELOG; CONTRIBUTING; license decision note; architecture, roadmap, development, testing, privacy, App Store notes and two ADRs. Original prompt preserved in docs/project-brief.txt.
## Decisions
On-device core; iOS 26 minimum; native Apple speech planned behind an engine boundary; services deferred until needed; no third-party dependencies.
## Build result / tests
No Xcode or Swift toolchain on Windows. Apple build, UI tests and device runtime checks not executed. Static project integrity checks do not establish compilation. Acceptance criteria are not yet satisfied.
## Manual verification
Follow docs/development.md to build/test on Mac; perform every Phase 0 check in docs/testing.md and record evidence.
## Limitations
Foundation only; no microphone, recognition, persistence, readiness or production icon. Placeholder identifier and signing team require owner setup. Offline transcription remains unimplemented.
## Git
Local repository initialized if absent. Review git status and git diff --check before staging. Suggested commit: chore: establish vReader iOS project foundation. No remote/push or automatic commit.
## Next phase exact objectives
After successful Phase 0 validation and explicit approval: microphone permission and usage description; AVAudioSession/AVAudioEngine capture; Start Listening/Stop and status; explicit permission/listening/error states; denied permission, unavailable input and engine failure; lifecycle behavior; optional level meter; practical transition tests and real-device procedure. No transcription in Phase 1.

## Static validation results
Passed: 26 unique Xcode project objects, all object references resolved, shared scheme XML parsed and target references valid, no trailing whitespace in authored files.
Git initialized on main; no commits exist, and generated project files are untracked.
These checks do not parse Swift or replace an Xcode build. No Apple runtime tests were run.
